# renewableenergy

#10 renewable can make 13 renewable. 
fossil fuels decrease in scale but renewable energy can only increase.
renewable energy can create more renewable energy at about 10%, this energy can be added on to itself every year. 
Goal is to get the renewable energy number to be twice as large as the fossil fuel number within 25 years. 
Potentially could reach goal with less.
have renewable energy graphic expand in scale as the years increase(once fossil fuel is not needed renewable energy will continue to create itself)
have the game to make an attempt to explain how the new energy created is being provided to the governing countries
